# PokemonWeaknessDiscordBot
A discord.py bot that utilizes pokebase to calculate a Pokemon's weakness! My favorite Pokemon is Vaporeon btw(but I do have a whole list of faves).  
I made three versions of the calculator:  
<ul> 
  <li>The initial, pre-library version where it only calculates weaknesses of a single type with a dictionary. </li>
  <li>The second version is a calculator that used PokeAPI and the python wrapper library PokeBase. It'll actually calculate the weakness of an inputted Pokemon</li>
  <li>The current version is a discord bot that uses the code from the second version. With the !weakness {pokemon} command, you can calculate a weakness of a Pokemon on Discord. </li>
</ul>

The .env file(not included here) contains the token to my guild/server.  
Something the bot misses is how certain immunities grant extra resistances/immunities/weaknesses, which I may add in a future update for fun.
